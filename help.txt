FDR Inaugural Address:
    I am certain that my fellow Americans expect
    That on my induction into the Presidency
    I will address them with a candor and a decision
    Which the present situation of our Nation impels.
    This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, 
    The whole truth, frankly and boldly.
