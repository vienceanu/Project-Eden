You begin your descent towards the surface of a rocky planet
You must be prepared to evade smaller peices of rock that are floating in orbit
A good strategy is to engage shields just in case.
Rocky planets are resource rich, but mining intensive. 
They also tend to have dense, molten cores that can be exploited. 
Landing can be a challenge, the terrain is extrememly varied and finding a suitable landing point
is difficult. Landing inside canyons or craters will provide protection against
the brutal storms and winds present but may be further from mining points. 
The temperatures on rocky planets can change instantly and you must be prepared to act accordingly.
Nightfall is always a danger as the temperature plummets to absolute zero.
You must act quick to avoid getting caught. Should nightfall catch you unprepared, 
significant resources will be used by the ships heating systems to keep it viable.
