You approach the planet careful, as though the atmosphere parts ways.
The air is unbearably thick, and unbreathable. You immediately don
your air system. You know from basic training that some gas planets have acidic
atmospheres. Nothing could've prepared you for the real thing. 
As you descend towards the surface, you hear the hull sizzling and creaking. 
The high temparatures and acidic nature of the atmosphere
are wreaking havoc on the ship. There isn't much time now,
you must engage the shields and get cooling online.
As the systems ramp up, the noise subsides. You are safe inside the ship.
A sensation of relief washes over you. That was a close call, 
closer than it should be. Reflecting on training you realize how unprepared 
you are. You must think quick and be adaptable if you are to be successful
