You were uncosncious for quite some time. My memory banks were severely damaged,
so I'm not sure how we ended up like this. Our comms are completely out, so I 
cannot get in touch with Earth for assistance.

We've almost drifted out of the solar system. Now that you've repaired the ship,
I'll use some of our remaining fuel to take us to Pluto. Once we're there, you'll 
need to find more fuel.
