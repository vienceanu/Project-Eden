You were uncosncious for quite some time.

While unconscious we had several distress calls, 
Earth is currently hailing us from outside of our radio range. 
(Only faint voices are heard in the intercom)

I believe that our ship has also sustained quite a bit of damage in the explosion.

Our location is currently almost out of the solar system. Lets try to get back into
the system and dock on Pluto for some emergency repairs.
