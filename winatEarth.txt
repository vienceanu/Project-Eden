You did it! you made it back to earth with a cargo of precious resources. These
metals, minerals, and elements will go a long way in helping humanity get back 
on it's feet. Thanks cadet! Or should I say... Captain! That's right! You're a
captain now! 

You can rest now that your long mission is over, or you can head back out there right away
What will you choose?
